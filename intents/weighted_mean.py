""" This modile contains the weighted mean intent.
The weighted mean intent finds the mean of column weighted by another
column.
The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean
(the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the
data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points
contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in
descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several
other areas of mathematics.

If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the
arithmetic mean. While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion
to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as
captured for instance in Simpson's paradox.

Madlib :
    Type 1 : "Mean of <column1> weighted by <column2> where <filters> and
              <date-range>"
    Type 2 : "Mean of <column1> weighted by <column2> for each <grouping>
              where <filters> and <date-range>"

In Type 1 the result contains only 1 number as the result.
And in Type 2 the result is a table and a correlation coefficient for each
of the groupings.
