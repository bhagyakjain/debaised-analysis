"""This module detects the cases of regression to the mean in the top-k
intent.
Regression toward the mean is the phenomenon that arises if a random
variable is extreme on its first or first few measurements but closer
to the mean or average on further measurements.
If the top-k is queried for a time window in which the results look much
different from the previous window, or the next window of the same size, the
oversight suggestion is passed.
