"""This module detects the cases of attribution with hidden negative
whenever user uses the summary_operator as proportion

Attribution with Hidden Negative is the oversight which arises whenever
there is a negative value present among the values on which proportion is
being applied. Therefore, if the summary_operator is proportion of <sum/count> 
and the values contains a negative value , the oversight is passed.
