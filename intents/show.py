    """This function will implement the show intent

    Firstly removes the tuples that do not lie in the given date range.
    Then applies slicing and groupby operations.
    The argument 'table' is not optional , hence passed as it is.
    Rest of the arguments are optional , hence passed in kwargs
    If the summary_operator is not None , it groups by dimensions.
    If some of the optional args are None (not passed),
    it is assumed that we don't have to apply them.

    Args:
        table: Type-pandas.dataframe
            It has the contents of the csv file
        metric: Type-string
            It is the name of the column on which
            summary operator is applied in case of grouping. Metric could a column
            containing strings, if we are applying count operator on it.
        dimensions: Type-list of str
            It is the name of column we want.
            In query:'show all batsman', dimension is 'batsman'.
            When summary_operator is not None, we group by dimensions.
        date_range: Type-tuple
            Tuple of start_date and end_date
        date_column_name: Type-str
            It is the name of column which contains date
        day_first: Type-str
            Day_first denotes that does day in the date occurs before month in the
            dates in the date column
            Example - '29-02-19', here day_first is true
        slices: Type-List of tuples
            Tuple represents the conditon to keep the row.
            (column_name, filter, value)
            column_name - is the value of the column that the
            condition is applied upon.
            filter - Filters enum members, ex. Filters.IN
        summary_operator: Type-summary_operators enum members
            It denotes the summary operator, after grouping by dimensions.
            ex. SummaryOperators.MAX, SummaryOperators.SUM

    Note-summary_operator is always applied on metric column passed,
         and only when grouping is done

    Returns:
        The function will return the `table(a pandas dataframe object)`
